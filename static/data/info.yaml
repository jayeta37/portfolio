about_me:
  - Hello, I am Jayesh Santosh Tawade, a passionate data engineer and AI enthusiast with a Master’s degree in Embedded Systems Engineering specializing in Artificial Intelligence. My journey has been shaped by diverse experiences, including working as a Research Associate at the University of Regensburg and contributing as an Embedded Systems Engineer at Goodbot.
  - I thrive on solving complex challenges, such as designing data pipelines, developing machine learning models and deploying scalable solutions. My projects have ranged from stabilizing robotic actions to predictive modeling for disaster management and sentiment analysis for stock market forecasting. I am also deeply committed to honing my problem-solving skills by regularly tackling data structure and algorithm (DSA) challenges and staying updated on advancements in technology.
  - Beyond my professional pursuits, I love watching anime, reading manga,\ and listening to music and thought-provoking podcasts. I am passionate about conversations about space and time. I find working out to be a great way to stay active and focused. These interests fuel my creativity and help me approach challenges with a fresh perspective.

monologue:
  - I began my academic journey with a Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics from the University of Mumbai, India. During my undergraduate studies, I developed a strong foundation in core engineering principles, problem-solving and programming, which set the stage for my future endeavors in advanced technologies.
  - Building on this foundation, I pursued a Master’s degree in Embedded Systems Engineering at Albert Ludwigs Universität Freiburg, Germany, specializing in Artificial Intelligence. This program allowed me to delve deep into machine learning, data processing and system optimization while gaining hands-on experience in implementing AI-based solutions. My Master’s thesis focused on stabilizing robotic end-effectors using one-shot imitation learning, showcasing my ability to address real-world challenges with innovative AI applications.
